# IMDb-Analysis
Technology used in this analysis project is Tableau. For doing this project I have taken raw data from IMDb site. It has 18 columns and approximately 3000 rows. In this first thing I did was to
clean the data properly as it was raw unclean data and had many duplicacy issues and some date issues. It is a self-learning project.
